- Learn proper administration techniques and dosing schedules
- Identify and manage common side effects

## Introduction

Starting a new medication like Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, requires careful attention to dosing. This guide outlines the initial loading phase over the first eight weeks, how Semaglutide works, what to expect, and how to manage side effects.

## Understanding Semaglutide

Semaglutide mimics hormones that stimulate insulin secretion, helping control blood sugar and reduce appetite, leading to weight loss.

## Monitoring Progress

Schedule regular telehealth appointments to track your progress and manage any side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea, which often subside as your body adjusts.

## Importance of the Loading Phase

The loading phase allows your body to adapt gradually, minimizing the risk of severe side effects and enhancing treatment effectiveness.

## Self-Administration Tips

### Injection Technique
- Administer subcutaneously (under the skin)
- Rotate injection sites (stomach, thigh, upper arm)

### Timing
- Inject on the same day each week
- Preferably before bedtime to sleep through potential side effects

### Hydration
- Stay hydrated to help mitigate gastrointestinal side effects

## Common Side Effects

Gastrointestinal issues like nausea are common but can often be managed with hydration and small, frequent meals. Consult your healthcare provider if side effects persist.

## Contraindications

## Best Practices
