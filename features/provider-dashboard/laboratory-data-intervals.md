# Laboratory Data and Intervals

## Overview
Guidelines for laboratory testing intervals and dashboard reminders for healthcare providers.

## Laboratory Testing Schedule

### Initial Laboratory Tests
- **Timing**: Before start of program
- **Requirements**: 
  - If lab tests are within 6 months of the start of program, it is acceptable to move forward to implement and start program after review
  - Place a **hard stop** on this value for the HCP dashboard

### First Year Laboratory Tests
- **Timing**: 6 months during first year of program
- **Dashboard Actions**:
  - Place a 1-month reminder for HCP dashboard to order lab tests
  - Place an overdue reminder on the dashboard if not completed at the indicated due date

### Annual Laboratory Tests
- **Timing**: After first year, annual cadence
- **Dashboard Actions**:
  - Place a 1-month reminder for HCP dashboard to order lab tests
  - Place an overdue reminder on dashboard if not completed at indicated due date

## Conditions Requiring 6-Month Lab Tests

The following conditions require laboratory testing every 6 months:

1. **Diabetes**
2. **Pre-Diabetes**
3. **Fatty Liver**
4. **Thyroid Condition**
5. **Cancer**

## Dashboard Implementation Requirements

### Reminder System
1. **1-Month Pre-Due Reminders**: Alert providers 1 month before labs are due
2. **Overdue Notifications**: Prominent alerts when labs are past due date
3. **Hard Stop Feature**: Prevent program start if initial labs are older than 6 months

### Lab Panel
- All lab data uses the same order panel as indicated in the laboratory data specifications

## Key Points for Provider Workflow
- Automated reminders help ensure timely lab ordering
- Dashboard should clearly display when labs were last completed
- Special attention to high-risk conditions requiring more frequent monitoring
- System should track compliance with laboratory testing schedules
