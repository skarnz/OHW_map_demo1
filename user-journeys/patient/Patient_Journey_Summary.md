# Patient Journey Summary - OHW Weight Management Program

## Overview

The OHW (Optimal Health & Wellness) Weight Management Program implements a structured 12-month patient journey combining medical interventions, behavioral modification, and digital health technology. This document summarizes the key findings from analyzing the patient journey documentation.

## Journey Structure

### Program Duration: 12 Months
- **Total Visits**: 22 scheduled encounters
- **Visit Types**: 
  - NPV (New Patient Visit): 30 minutes
  - RPV (Return Patient Visit): 15-30 minutes

### Phase Progression
1. **Intensive Phase** (Weeks 0-8): Weekly visits
2. **Transition Phase** (Weeks 9-16): Bi-weekly visits  
3. **Maintenance Phase** (Months 5-12): Monthly visits

## Key Journey Components

### 1. Multi-Track Approach
- **GLP-1 Medication Track**: For patients using semaglutide or similar medications
- **DPP Track**: CDC-approved Diabetes Prevention Program curriculum
- **Hybrid Options**: Combination of medication and lifestyle intervention

### 2. 5A Framework Implementation
Every visit follows the standardized 5A approach:
- **Assess**: Measurements and data review
- **Advise**: Evidence-based recommendations
- **Agree**: Collaborative goal setting
- **Assist**: Problem-solving and support
- **Arrange**: Follow-up planning

### 3. Technology Integration
- **Patient Mobile App**: Daily tracking, education access, progress monitoring
- **Provider Dashboard**: Clinical oversight, data analytics, population health
- **AI Support**: 24/7 microlearning modules and query response
- **Data Ecosystem**: EHR integration, photo documentation, lab results

## Critical Milestones

### Clinical Milestones
1. **Week 0**: Comprehensive intake, baseline labs, first medication dose
2. **Week 4**: First photo comparison and dose optimization
3. **Week 8**: Phase transition assessment
4. **Week 15**: Follow-up laboratory work
5. **Month 6**: Maintenance planning initiation
6. **Month 12**: Program graduation or continuation decision

### Behavioral Milestones
1. **Week 1-2**: Tracking habit establishment
2. **Week 3-4**: First behavioral challenges addressed
3. **Month 2-3**: Independence in self-management
4. **Month 4-6**: Plateau navigation skills
5. **Month 7-12**: Long-term maintenance behaviors

## User Flow Patterns

### Onboarding Flow
```
Referral → Initial Assessment → Lab Work → Consent → 
Goal Setting → Tool Training → First Visit → Daily Tracking Begins
```

### Daily App Flow
```
Morning: Check goals → Log breakfast → Review tips
Midday: Log lunch → Track activity → Quick learning
Evening: Log dinner → Complete daily summary → Plan tomorrow
```

### Visit Preparation Flow
```
Week Before: Reminder notification → Data review prompt
Day Before: Confirm appointment → Complete pre-visit survey
Visit Day: Check-in → Provider review → Update plan → Schedule next
```

## Success Factors

### Patient Success Indicators
- **Engagement**: >80% tracking compliance
- **Attendance**: >90% visit completion
- **Progress**: 5-10% body weight reduction
- **Retention**: >70% program completion
- **Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating

### Program Design Elements
1. **Graduated Intensity**: Decreasing visit frequency promotes independence
2. **Multi-Modal Support**: In-person, digital, and AI-powered assistance
3. **Personalization**: Customizable goals and intervention strategies
4. **Evidence-Based**: CDC-approved content and clinical best practices
5. **Data-Driven**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment based on outcomes

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 (MVP) Requirements
- Core patient tracking features (weight, food, fitness)
- Basic provider dashboard
- Authentication and security
- Essential microlearning content (first 8 weeks)

### Phase 2 Enhancements
- AI-powered coaching
- Advanced analytics
- Community features
- Complete educational library
- Telemedicine integration

### Critical Infrastructure
- HIPAA-compliant data storage
- Scalable cloud architecture
- Real-time synchronization
- Offline capability for mobile app
- Integration APIs for labs/EHR

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Failure Points
1. **Early Dropout** (Weeks 3-4): Enhanced support protocols
2. **Transition Anxiety** (Week 9): Clear communication about continued care
3. **Plateau Frustration** (Months 4-5): Advanced problem-solving resources
4. **Pre-Graduation Concerns** (Months 10-11): Maintenance planning focus

### Mitigation Strategies
- Proactive outreach at high-risk timepoints
- Flexible scheduling for life events
- Multiple support channel options
- Clear escalation procedures
- Non-scale victory celebrations

## Conclusion

The OHW patient journey represents a comprehensive, technology-enabled approach to weight management that balances clinical oversight with patient empowerment. The 12-month structure provides sufficient time for sustainable behavior change while the graduated intensity model promotes long-term independence. Success depends on seamless integration of clinical care, digital tools, and educational support throughout the patient's transformation journey.
